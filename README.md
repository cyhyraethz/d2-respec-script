### Requirements

Node.js (tested against version 17.3.0)

Only works on save files from patch 1.00 - 1.08

### Usage

Run the script with your save file as the first parameter
and it will unassign all of your skill points and attributes

### Example

./respec.js "Cyhyraeth.d2s"

./respec.js "C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\Save\Cyhyraeth.d2s"

./respec.js "~/Games/diablo-ii/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Diablo II/Save/Cyhyraeth.d2s"

### Notes

Path to save file can be a relative path or an absolute path

If the path contains spaces it needs to be wrapped in quotes

### Warning

I have tested the script thoroughly, however it would still be
advisable to create a backup of your save file before using the
script to protect yourself against any potential data loss

I highly recommend creating regular backups of your save files
anyway, ideally to some type of remote storage
